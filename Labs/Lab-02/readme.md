# Lab 02 - Doing more with lights

This lab extends the previous lab, so you can decide whether to run it from here or just extend the lab you previously built.

All this lab does is a little more with the lights!

## Prerequisites
1.Lab-01 prerequities
2. A working lab-01 preferably

## In this lab
So far, we can display the matrix of lights and set a specific pixel, but there is no means to get the brightness of a specific pixel.

The tasks for this lab are:
1. to add a method for getting the value of the pixel.
2. set a pixel to on or off
3. get the status of a pixel in terms of whether it is on or off
4. clear the whole display

Some hints: 
1. the method to set the value of a pixel has most of what is needed to get the value
2. is on an off really necessary? Would brightness just do?
3. clearing the display has some of the characteristics of either the orginal initialisation of the lights or the display method
