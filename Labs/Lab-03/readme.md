# Lab 03 Microbit
This lab will use a Micro:bit as an example of a less than virtual device that can be controlled by semantic kernel planner.

The Micro:bit has a 5x5 matrix of LEDs - which is why the lights labs have this representation.

## Prerequisites
1. As previous labs
2. A Microbit plugged in the the USB of the your laptop/PC

Hopefully some of the proctors can bring along a collection of these.
